# Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. It leverages various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features of the Project

- **Data Analysis:** Utilizes libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and exploration.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements models using the `sklearn` library to train and evaluate heart disease predictions.
- **Google Colab Integration:** Includes support for running the project in Google Colab for ease of use.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `google` (for Colab integration)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting relevant features for training the model.
3. **Model Training:** Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can assist in early detection of heart disease, potentially helping healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.
